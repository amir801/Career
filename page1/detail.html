    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. 
    These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases,<br>
    networking, and software
        Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons 
            including cost savings, increased productivity,<br> speed and efficiency, performance,
            and security.</p>
        
                    <p>Cloud computing can be both public and private. Public cloud services provide their  services over the Internet for a fee. Private cloud services, on the other hand, only 
                        provide services to a <br> certain number of people. These services are a system of networks 
                        that supply hosted services. There is also a hybrid option, which combines elements of both the public and private services.</p>

                Internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, <br>
                and software.</li>
             <li>Cloud-based storage makes it possible to save files to a remote <br>
                    database and retrieve them on demand.</li>
                 <li>Services can be both public and private public services are provided <br>
                         online for a fee while private services are hosted on a network to <br>
                          specific clients.</li>

                    </ul>
    <h3>Types of Cloud Services</h3>
    <p>Regardless of the kind of service, cloud computing services provide users with <br>
         a series of functions including:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Email</li>
             <li>Storage, backup, and data retrieval</li>
             <li>Creating and testing apps</li>
             <li>Analyzing data</li>
             <li>Audio and video streaming</li>
         </ul>
    
<h3>The World of Business</h3>
<p>Businesses can employ cloud computing in different ways. Some users maintain all apps  and data on the cloud, while others use a hybrid model, keeping certain apps <br> and data on private servers and others on the cloud.</p>
